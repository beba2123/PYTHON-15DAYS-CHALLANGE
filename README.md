Python 15-days challange..

python is dynamic typing which means that we can use built in function like int,Str,..when we assing value  
 we can write it b=4, ant="Anteneh",--> this means like dynamicly typing.
String is a sequence of character, using a syntax of single quote or double quote..
eg. "beba", 'beba'
-->> so due to it ordered sequence we can slice or index the character inside the string.
Eg. a = "beba";
a[0]==> output -> b using the index method.
a[start:stop:step], start the index that the slice start, stop the index you will go upto but not include step is the size of the jump you take..
==>> String are immutable which means that we cannot change them .
Eg. a = 'abera'
if we say a[0] = b ==> it create an error becouse due to immutable behavior.
==>>there are diffrent method which uses to change the string property like 'varible name'.upper(), 'variable name'.lower(), 'variable name'.split().
